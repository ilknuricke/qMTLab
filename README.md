qMTLab
======

qMTLab provides a framework for standardizing the validation and fitting of qMT data. The software package is developed and will be made freely available, at the ISMRM 2015 conference, to the MR community and is hoped to become a valuable tool for future qMT studies, leading the way toward fast, robust and clinically feasible qMT protocols. Any questions may be forwarded to sharktank.bic@gmail.com.
